# Internship Recommendation System using Machine Learning

Accessed Website: https://intershiprecommendation.streamlit.app/

# Why this project is created? 
Internship searching is a challenging task, and the process of finding the right opportunities that align with your skills and aspirations can be time-consuming. Therefore, the goal of this system is to simplify and enhance the internship search experience. By uploading your resume, the system analyzes its key strengths and matches them with a curated list of internship postings. This personalized approach aims to help users discover relevant opportunities more efficiently.

### The primary objectives of this project include:

#### Facilitating Easier Internship Discovery: The system leverages natural language processing techniques, such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity, to recommend internship postings that closely match the content of your resume. This assists users in discovering opportunities that align with their qualifications and preferences.

#### Empowering Users to Identify Resume Strengths: In addition to internship recommendations, the system provides insights into the key strengths of your resume. By understanding which skills and experiences are highlighted, users can gain valuable insights into how their profiles are perceived by potential employers.

#### Learning and Skill Development: Behind the scenes, this project serves as a learning experience in the field of data science application development for me. It involves the implementation of various natural language processing techniques and optimization strategies to enhance the performance and efficiency of the recommendation system.

## Step 1: Upload the Resume as PDF 
## Step 2: Get your job based on your resume 
It is that easy and effective to search for your job postings based on your resume. The jobs are updated as soon as the jobs are posted, and if you use Simplify to apply for jobs. It is even easier for you to apply for them.

# Database
The internship database is from Simplify: https://simplify.jobs/l/Top-Summer-Internships. 

# Machine Learning Process:
My machine learning techniques implement the use of TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique and cosine similarity to match the descriptions of the job postings to the key words identified by the vectorization methods of the resume. The vectors effectively identifies the significance of the each word of the resume and job posting, and cosine similarity matches job postings with the resume keywords.
